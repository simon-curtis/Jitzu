// Test 13: Comprehensive example combining multiple namespace features

// Define a simple type for representing dates
type Date {
    pub year: Int,
    pub month: Int,
    pub day: Int
}

// Define a person type
type Person {
    pub firstName: String,
    pub lastName: String,
    pub birthDate: Date,
    pub email: String
}

// Define an organization
type Organization {
    pub name: String,
    pub foundedDate: Date,
    pub employees: Int
}

// Define a contract between a person and organization
type Employment {
    pub person: Person,
    pub organization: Organization,
    pub startDate: Date,
    pub position: String
}

// Create sample data
let birthDate = Date { year = 1990, month = 5, day = 15 }
let person = Person {
    firstName = "John",
    lastName = "Doe",
    birthDate = birthDate,
