# Getting Started with Jitzu

Welcome to Jitzu, a modern scripting language designed to be "Fast Enough™, Overengineered, and Unoriginal" - packed with syntax sugar to make scripting fun and expressive.

## What is Jitzu?

Jitzu is a modern scripting language that combines features from Rust, C#, F#, Go, TypeScript, Scala, and Zig.
It's designed for both script execution and interactive shell usage, prioritizing developer productivity and expressiveness.

## Design Philosophy

Jitzu is designed to be:

- **Fast Enough™** - Optimized for developer productivity over raw performance
- **Overengineered** - Includes many language features for expressiveness
- **Unoriginal** - Borrows the best ideas from other languages
- **Fun to use** - Syntax sugar makes common tasks enjoyable

## Your First Jitzu Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`// Simple Hello World
print("Hello, World!")`} />

Save this as `hello.jz` and run it with the Jitzu interpreter.

## String Interpolation

One of Jitzu's most convenient features is string interpolation using template literals:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`// With string interpolation
let name = "Jitzu"
print(\`Hello from {name}!\`)

// You can use expressions inside interpolation
let version = 1.0
print(\`Welcome to {name} version {version}!\`)`} />

## Basic Program Structure

Jitzu programs are collections of expressions and statements:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`// Variables
let greeting = "Hello"
let language = "Jitzu"

// Function definition
fun welcome(name: String): String {
    \`{greeting} from {language}, {name}!\`
}

// Using the function
let message = welcome("Developer")
print(message)`} />

## Key Language Features at a Glance

### Mutable and Immutable Variables

Use `mut` for mutable data:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`let x = 42          // Immutable
let mut counter = 0 // Mutable
counter += 1`} />

### Everything is an Expression

Functions automatically return the last expression:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    a + b  // No 'return' needed
}`} />

### Strong Type System with Inference

Types are inferred when possible, but you can be explicit:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`let age = 25              // Inferred as Int
let name: String = "Alice" // Explicit type`} />

### Pattern Matching

Match expressions for control flow:

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`union Shape {
    Circle(Double),
    Square(Double),
}

let description = match shape {
    Shape.Circle(r) => \`Circle with radius {r}\`,
    Shape.Square(s) => \`Square with side {s}\`,
}`} />

## Quick Reference

### Common Operations

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`// Variables
let x = 42
let mut y = 10

// String interpolation
print(\`x = {x}, y = {y}\`)

// Basic arithmetic
let sum = x + y
let difference = x - y

// Conditionals
if x > y {
    print("x is greater")
}

// Loops
for i in 1..=5 {
    print(\`Count: {i}\`)
}`} />

### File Structure

- Source files use `.jz` extension
- Use `open` statements for imports
- Programs start executing from top-level expressions
