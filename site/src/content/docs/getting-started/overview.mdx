# What is Jitzu?

Jitzu is two things in one: an **interactive shell** you use as your terminal, and a **typed scripting language** you write real programs in. Both share the same runtime, the same type system, and the same package ecosystem.

## The Shell

Jitzu ships with `jzsh`, a shell that replaces bash, zsh, or PowerShell for daily use. It has the commands you expect — `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep` — plus features built for modern workflows:

- **Tab completion** for files, commands, variables, and types
- **Typed pipes** that flow OS command output into Jitzu functions
- **Ctrl+R reverse search**, arrow-key history predictions, and a git-aware prompt
- **Directory labels** — name a directory once, use it as a path prefix everywhere

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`simon ~/projects/api (main) *
> find src -ext cs
src/Parser.cs
src/Lexer.cs
src/Interpreter.cs

> git log --oneline | first
a1b2c3d Add pattern matching support

> label git ~/git/
> cd git:jitzu/site`} />

## The Language

At the prompt or in `.jz` files, you write in a language that borrows from Rust, C#, F#, and TypeScript. It's expression-based, statically typed with inference, and has pattern matching, union types, and string interpolation built in.

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`// Variables — immutable by default
let name = "Jitzu"
let mut counter = 0

// Functions return their last expression
fun greet(who: String): String {
    \`Hello, {who}!\`
}

// Union types and pattern matching
union Shape {
    Circle(Double),
    Square(Double),
}

let area = match shape {
    Shape.Circle(r) => 3.14159 * r ** 2,
    Shape.Square(s) => s ** 2,
}`} />

## NuGet Packages

Any .NET NuGet package works out of the box. Add a directive, import what you need, and use it — no project files, no restore step.

<CodeBlock language="jitzu" code={`#:package Newtonsoft.Json@13.0.4
open "Newtonsoft.Json" as { JsonConvert }

let json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(user)
print(json)`} />

## Runtime

Jitzu compiles your code to bytecode and runs it on a stack-based VM built on .NET 10. It's fast enough for scripting and interactive use, and gives you access to the entire .NET ecosystem.
