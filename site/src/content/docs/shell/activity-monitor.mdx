# Activity Monitor

The Jitzu shell includes a built-in full-screen activity monitor TUI, background job management,
command timing, and process control commands.

## The Monitor Command

Run `monitor` to open a live-updating full-screen dashboard showing:

- **CPU usage** — overall percentage with per-core sparkline bars and gradient coloring (green through red)
- **Memory usage** — used/total with sparkline graph
- **Network** — send/receive rates with sparkline history
- **Disk usage** — per-drive gauge bars
- **Process list** — navigable tree view with PID, CPU%, memory, and command name

### Monitor Controls

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>q / Escape</code></td><td>Quit the monitor</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>Up / Down</code></td><td>Navigate process list</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>k</code></td><td>Send SIGTERM to selected process</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>kk</code> (double tap)</td><td>Send SIGKILL to selected process</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>/</code></td><td>Filter processes by name</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>f</code></td><td>Toggle: show only shell child processes</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The monitor renders with bordered panels, gradient sparklines, and color-coded metrics.
It refreshes automatically and adapts to terminal size changes.

## Background Jobs

Append `&` to any command to run it in the background.
The shell returns a job ID and process ID immediately, and the prompt stays responsive.

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`> dotnet build &
[1] 12345

> sleep 10 &
[2] 12346`} />

### Managing Jobs

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>jobs</code></td><td>List all background jobs with status (Running/Done)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>fg [%id]</code></td><td>Bring a job to the foreground (waits for completion, shows output)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>bg</code></td><td>List background jobs (alias for jobs)</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`> jobs
[1]  Running    dotnet build
[2]  Done       sleep 10

> fg %1
[1]  dotnet build
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)`} />

Completed jobs are reported automatically at the next prompt. The prompt also shows the count of
active background jobs (e.g. `[2]`).

## Command Timing

Use `time` to measure how long a command takes to execute:

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`> time dotnet build
Build succeeded.

real    0m2.345s`} />

Commands that take longer than 2 seconds also show their duration in the prompt
line automatically (e.g. `took 5s`).

## Watch

The `watch` command repeats a command at regular intervals.
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`> watch -n 5 date
Every 5.0s: date

Sat Feb 14 14:23:00 2026`} />

Default interval is 2 seconds. Use `-n` to specify a different interval.

## Process Management

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>kill [-9] pid</code></td><td>Kill a process by PID or <code>%jobid</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>killall [-9] name</code></td><td>Kill all processes matching a name</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<CodeBlock language="shell" code={`> kill %1
[1]  Terminated  dotnet build

> kill 12345
Process 12345 terminated.

> kill -9 12345
Process 12345 killed.

> killall node
Killed 3 process(es) named 'node'.`} />

The `-9` flag sends SIGKILL (force kill) instead of SIGTERM (graceful termination).
Use `%id` to reference background jobs by their job ID.
